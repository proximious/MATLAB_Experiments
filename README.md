# MATLAB_Experiments

Some experiments I did in Matlab that I found interesting

### Files:

*linear_fitter_test.m* 

I wanted to create a linear fitter. The code generates a lot of random noisy data then creates a line to fit the data.

*tutoring.m*

Checking out some things like convergence, round off, truncation, Newton Raphson methods, and LU decomposition.
