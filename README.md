# MATLAB_Experiments

Some experiments I did in Matlab that I found interesting

### Files:

*linear_fitter_test.m* 

I wanted to create a linear fitter. The code generates a lot of random noisy data then creates a line to fit the data.

*tutoring.m*

Checking out some things like convergence, round off, truncation, Newton Raphson methods, and LU decomposition.

*WineChemisty.m*

Created a linear regression to find out what qualities in wine make it more enjoyable to drink from a given data set.

*droplet_radiation.m*

Testing the trapezoid rule to plot a cooling time function.

*stent_development.m*

I wanted to see an example of a surf map, so I found an online example using probability of successful stent treatment.
